# print(STATEMENTS)
Print statements is a safe haven that brings artists & consumers together in harmony. It allows artists to take control of the distribution of their work, and share their passions with the general public. As well as bringing an interactive, engaging platform for the public to find pieces from their favourite artists, as well as allowing them to discover new & upcoming figures within the art world.

## UX

### Site Purpose:
The intent of the site is to bring Artists & Consumers together. [“print(STATEMENTS)”](https://print-statements.herokuapp.com/) Is an online printing service where known & aspiring artists can submit their work. In doing so, they will also select the medium in which they would like their work to be printed, along with the price, and number of limited edition copies they would like to sell. Upon doing so, the artwork will then be displayed on the site, available to the general public for purchase. Each unique piece of artwork will be signed & numbered, and issued with a statement of authenticity, so that enthusiastic collectors can own a piece of their favourite artist.

### Site Goal:
To build a platform that allows artists to easily share their work and passions with their fans, and art lovers who have yet to discover their talents. As well as to bring an engaging experience to artists and consumers alike. By having a display of artwork from a range of individuals, art-lovers will be able to easily peruse through pieces that engage them in a way that only art can.

### Audience:
For everyone with a thirst for beauty in their lives. For the experienced art collectors who know what they are looking for, as well as those just discovering the art world with fresh new eyes. The ideal user age is between 20-50 years of age.

### Communication:
With a clean, easy to follow layout, the user - both artist and consumer alike - are guided through the features of the website with an ease of navigation.

### Current User Goals:
For Artists to easily be able to supply their work to the art world and be discovered by new & old collectors. For Collectors to not only find works by the artists they admire, but to also discover new artists along the way.

### New User Goals:
To become instantly engaged with the design of the site, and feel intrigued to explore all it has to offer.

### Future Goals:
- To create a profile page for each artist, which the site users can peruse.
- To view all the available artwork created by an artist both on their profile page, and by clicking on the artist name when viewing an artwork.
- To allow users to follow artists directly, and receive email notifications when new works are available for sale.
- To have an online shop that will make the individual artworks available for sale.
- For the remaining number of artworks to be instantly displayed on the prints page under "remaining prints."
- To provide access for the artists to not only select the number of limited edition prints they would like to sell, but also choose the size of the work, along with the medium on which is is printed (canvas, glossy print, mat, etc...)

## Testing
1. index.html page not loading:
 - Through trial and error, I changed the view code from a class to a function.
 - as well as removed the ```.as_view()``` from the URL path.

2. CSS styles not loading on blog page:
 - This [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial06/) indicated that the styles were incorrectly linked.
 - This was resolved updating the href link in the base.html to ```{% static 'css/style.css' %}```

3. Error message after installing Allauth:
 - Tutor support informed me that Heroku had updated my database url value.
 - This was resolved by updating the env.py file with the new URL.

4. Invalid "syntax" error after installing **crispy-forms**:
 - A comma was missing from within the BlogPostPage class.

5. Django error message after adding comment form:
 - CSRF token had been added as CRSF.
 - Correcting the error resolved the issue.

6. Console error after adding "Categories" field to Artprints model:
 - The console indicated that a default field had not been supplied.
 - As I did not remember that it would need to be an integer, I added ```default='undecided'``` to the field.
 - This produced further error messages.
 - I corrected the model, and attempted to migrate the changes once more. The same error continued to display on the console.
 - I looked up how to revert the migrations on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32123477/how-to-revert-the-last-migration) using the following command: ```./manage.py migrate artprints zero```, but this did not resolve the issue.
 - After consulting with a fellow student who had experienced something similar, [Mats Simonsson](https://github.com/Pelikantapeten), I then deleted the files out of the migrations folder within my app folder.
 - This resolved this issue.
 - However upon contemplation, I have understood that had the database been significantly populated with data, this would not be a reasonable approach to take, as it would eliminate important information.

7. URL paths for second app:
 - Being unable to submit an empty string as the first parameter in the main URLs folder, my weblink was displaying as **prints/prints/**.
 - Having tried multiple suggestions from numerous sources, I instead resorted to changing the main URL path to **art** so that any new URL path created in the second app file, would then display as **art/pathname**
 - This is not the resolution that I was looking for, however for aesthetics, I have accepted it as the solution for now.

8. Hero & About image not loading on deployed site:
 - These two images were stored directly within the django app as opposed to being uploaded to Cloudinary.
 - I tried numerous articles that suggested to change the URL path linked in the CSS file, and tried the following:
  - ```background: url(/static/images/gallery-wall.jpg) no-repeat;``` : As shown in [Simpleit](https://simpleit.rocks/python/django/call-static-templatetag-for-background-image-in-css/)
  - ```background: url('{% static "/images/gallery-wall.jpg" %}') no-repeat;``` : As showing in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5898776/how-to-refer-to-static-files-in-my-css-files)
  - ```background: url('{% static "images/gallery-wall.jpg" %}') no-repeat;```
  - ```background: url("{{ STATIC_URL }}images/gallery-wall.jpg") no-repeat;```
  - ```background: url(static("images/gallery-wall.jpg"));```
 - As none of these resolved the issue, and I was unable to ascertain the solution that I required, I instead resorted to loading the images directly into the HTML files as opposed to the CSS. 
 - Issue resolved.

9. Art submission form unable to complete:
 - Terminal error suggested no file was selected.
 - I read numerous articles on stackoverflow, cloudinary, comments on slack, and was unable to resolve this.
 - Ger from Tutor support indicated that the required field was missing from my form tags ```enctype="multipart/form-data```
 - Adding this resolved the issue.

10. User unable to submit multiple prints:
 - This was due to the slug field not being included in the form submission.
 - Another side effect of this, is that when the print was then approved via the admin panel, should the admin not pay attention and approve it without inserting a slug, the entire prints page would then fail to load.
 - To resolve this, the slug field was added to the form field.
 - Have not yet figured out how to have this auto-populate as it would were it submitted directly from the admin panel.
 - However, adding the slug field ensures that the "Create" feature of CRUD now works as intended.

11. Blog post page pushes social links to left:
 - Upon inspection in dev tools, the row containing the comments was being duplicated, causing the layout to shift.
 - Issue resolved by moving the ```{% endif %}``` inside of the closing div for the row.
 - This then caused an issue with the view when the user was logged out.
 - Once more, the opening & closing if statements needed to be moved outside the row entirely.

12. Submit multiple comments:
- Due to how the comments section was set up in the html file, upon submission of a comment, regardless of approval, the form would no longer be available to the user. Instead, a display message was constantly shown, suggesting that the comment was still pending approval, even if it had been approved.
- To resolve this, the section in the HTML was removed, and instead a line was added to the view function so that a success message would display on the screen after submission. This then allows the user to go and submit multiple comments on the same post, regardless of whether they have an approved or pending comment already submitted.

13. Testing CRUD functionality:
 - Each of the features were tested multiple times to ensure that numerous new posts could be submitted, and that each post had the ability to be updated and edited by the user that submitted it.
 - If a post is submitted by another user, the edit/delete buttons do not appear on the page.

14. Forms test failed to run:
 - When running the newly created test in forms.py, the following error occurred in the terminal: "Got an error creating the test database: permission denied to create database".
 - A [Slack comment](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C026PTF46F5/p1647428298841409?thread_ts=1647427231.501879&cid=C026PTF46F5) provided the answer for this, & suggested that the new DATABASES variable in the settings.py file needed to be commented out, and the original one to be made active again for the tests to work.
 - Following these steps allowed the test to perform as expected.

15. AssertionError: 301 != 200:
 - The second test implemented from the "Hello Django" project failed each time it was ran.
 - The answer on how to resolve it was ascertained from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21215035/django-test-always-returning-301), and adding an ```follow=True``` to the code in turn caused the tests to pass.

- Errors listed only reference {%%} & {{}} tags.

- CSS files pass through the [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no issues found.
